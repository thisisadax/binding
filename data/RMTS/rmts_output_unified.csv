Next, we identify the relations over the features represented in the source pair:
- Shape: The objects share the same shape.
- Color: The objects have different colors but are shades of the same color.
- Size: One object is larger in size than the other.

Now, we compare the target pairs to the source pair to determine which shares the same relations:

- Target Pair 1: One object is an orange square, and the other is a pink square. One object is larger than the other.
- Target Pair 2: One object is a pink triangle, and the other is a purple triangle. One object is larger than the other.

Target Pair 2 has objects that do not share the same shape, color, or size, so it does not match the relations of the source pair.

- In target pair 2, the relation is one of size only, with both objects being the same shape and color.

3. Lastly, we determine which target pair shares the same relations with the source pair:

- Shape: both objects have the same shape (circular).
- Color: both objects have the same color (orange).
- Size: both objects have the same size.

Now let's analyze the target pairs:
- Target Pair 1 (two crosses) does not match the source pair because even though both objects have the same color (blue and orange) and shape (crosses), the sizes of the objects are different (one is larger than the other).
- Target Pair 2 (two pink squares) matches the source pair because both objects have the same shape (squares), the same color (pink), and the same size, just like the source pair relations.

Therefore, Target Pair 2 is the correct match.",2
