   - Target Pair 1: two red circles of the same size. They share identical shape, color, and size.
   - Target Pair 2: two black squares but there is no feature over which they relate as with the source pair.

Step 1: Identify the features
- Source Pair: Both objects are blue hearts of the same size.
- Target Pair 1: Both objects are pink crosses of the same size.
- Target Pair 2: One object is a pink triangle and the other a pink square, with different sizes.

Step 2: Identify the relations
- Source Pair: The relation is that both objects are the same shape, color, and size.
- Target Pair 1: The relation is that both objects are the same shape, color, and size.
- Target Pair 2: The relation is that both objects are different shapes, the same color, and different sizes.

Step 3: Determine the matching relations
- The source pair has objects of the same shape, color, and size.
- Target Pair 1 has objects of the same shape, color, and size, which does NOT match the relations of the source pair because the source pair's objects don't have the same relation over shape (hearts vs crosses).
- Target Pair 2 has objects of different shapes, the same color, and different sizes, which DOES match the relations of the source pair in terms of shape and color, but not in size. However, since there is no other pair with the same combination of relations, Target Pair 2 is the closest match.

- Target Pair 1: The first object is heart-shaped and blue in color, while the second object is star-shaped and blue in color.
- Target Pair 2: Both objects are star-shaped, red in color, and identical in size.

Step 2: Identifying the relations over the features

   - Target Pair 1 features two squares that are red and are the same size. They share the same color and size but not the same shape as the source pair.
   - Target Pair 2 features a heart and a cross that are green and are the same size. The heart shape in the target pair matches the heart shape in the source pair, they share the same size, and while the colors are different, the relation of having two objects with the same color is retained.

- Target Pair 2: One object is a black square, and the other object is an orange triangle.

2. Identify the relations over the features represented in each pair:
- In the Source Pair, both objects share the same shape (square), color (black), and size.
- In Target Pair 1, both objects share the same shape (square), color (green), and size.
- In Target Pair 2, the objects do not share the same shape (one square, one triangle), do not share the same color (one black, one orange), and it's not possible to determine the relative size from the provided images.

3. Determine which target pair shares the same relations with the source pair:
- The Source Pair consists of two objects that are identical in terms of shape, color, and size.
- Target Pair 1 maintains this relationship, as both objects are identical squares that are the same size and color.
- Target Pair 2 does not maintain this relationship, as the objects differ in both shape and color.

4. Return the number of the target pair that matches the relations of the source pair and explain your reasoning:
- Target Pair 1 is the correct match because both of the objects are identical in terms of their features, much like the Source Pair where both objects are identical black squares. Target Pair 2 does not show identical objects, and thus does not match the relational structure of the Source Pair.",1

1. In the Source Pair, both are black squares, meaning they share the same shape, color, and size relations.
2. In Target Pair 1, both are blue hearts, also sharing the same shape, color, and size relations.
3. In Target Pair 2, one object is a blue star, and the other is a black square.

Also, they are different in size, which is not a relation represented in the Source Pair.
4. Since Target Pair 1 represents the same exact relations (same shape, same color, same size), it cannot be the matching pair because the Source Pair has different shapes and colors between its elements.
