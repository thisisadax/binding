   - Target Pair 2: Two green crosses of the same size.

2. Identify the relations over the features represented in each pair:

   - Target Pair 1: Different shape and same color, different size.
   - Target Pair 2: Identical shape and color, same size.

3. Determine which target pair shares the same relations with the source pair:

3. Target Pair 1 consists of two blue stars that also share the same color and shape but differ in size, thus matching the relations of the source pair.
4. Target Pair 2 consists of two black squares that differ in size but do not match the relations over color and shape, as they are same in color and shape, unlike the source pair which has same color and shape but different size.

Reasoning:
1. Source Pair: Both objects are green, triangular, and of the same size.

3. Target Pair 2: The objects are both pink and have a similar shape (a cross and a pentagon) but different sizes.

The relations in the Source Pair align with the relations in Target Pair 2 because the objects in the Source Pair have the same color, and differ in shape and size (the pentagon differs from the cross, and one is larger than the other). Even though they differ in exact shape, in the context of the task, ""same shape"" appears to be a broader category encompassing similar geometric shapes. 

Target Pair 1 does not match because the objects are the same size, which is not the relation seen in the Source Pair (where there is a difference in size).",1

- Target Pair 2: Both objects are orange and X shaped, with the same size.

Step 2: Identify the relations over the features represented in each pair.

In Target Pair 1, the objects are identical in shape, color, and size, just like the Source Pair. However, the shape and color are different from the Source Pair.

In Target Pair 2, the objects are identical in color but different in shape and size. The relationship between the two objects is that they share one feature (color) but differ in two (shape and size).

Target Pair 2 shares only one feature with the Source Pair - the color. They both have objects that are the same color but different in shape and size.

Firstly, we identify the features of the objects in the source pair: They are both heart-shaped, pink, and appear to be the same size.

Next, we identify the relations over the features represented in each pair:
- In the source pair, both objects share the same shape (heart), color (pink), and size.
- In target pair 1, the objects do not share the same shape (one is a triangle, the other is a cross), but they do share the same color (orange) and are the same size.
- In target pair 2, both objects share the same shape (square), color (black), and size.

Lastly, we determine which target pair shares the same relations with the source pair. Since the source pair shows objects that are identical in all three features, we look for the target pair that also has two objects identical in all three features. Target Pair 2 matches this description as both objects are identical squares, black in color, and the same size. Therefore, ""Target Pair 2"" shares the same relations with the source pair.",2

3. In Target Pair 1, both objects are the same shape (stars), color (blue), and size (different sizes; one is larger than the other), following the same relations as the Source Pair.

Explanation:
1. Features of the source pair: Both objects have the same shape (pentagon), color (pink), and size (equal).
2. Relations over the features in the source pair: The objects are identical in all three features.

Target Pair 1: Both objects have the same shape (heart), color (orange), and size (equal).
Target Pair 2: The objects have different shapes (pentagon and star), but they share the same color (green) and have different sizes.

3. Determination of the matching target pair:
Target Pair 1 does not match the source pair because the source pair consists of identical objects, while the objects in Target Pair 1 only share the same shape.
Target Pair 2 matches the source pair because it follows the same relation: the objects share one feature (color), which is the same relation in the source pair (where the objects share all three features). The difference in shape and size in the Target Pair 2 matches the relation of sameness in the source pair, just with different features being the same.",1

For Target Pair 1, the features are:

Target Pair 1 shares the same size relationship as the Source Pair, but the shapes and colors are different.

For Target Pair 2, the features are:

- Color: One object is green, and the other is pink
- Size: Both objects are of equal size

Target Pair 2 shares the same size and shape relationship as the Source Pair, but the colors are different. However, since both objects in the Source Pair are identical in all features and the Task specified the features to be shape, color, and size, it can be deduced that the Target Pair should match in all three features as well. Since the shapes match and both objects in Target Pair 2 are spades, and the sizes match because both objects are of equal size, the color is the feature that needs to be different. Since one object in Target Pair 2 is green, it maintains the color relationship of 'equal to one object in the Source Pair.'

2. The relations over the features represented in the Source Pair are:
   - Shape: Same shape (spade).
   - Color: Same color (pink).
   - Size: Size difference (large and small).

3. The features of the objects in Target Pair 1 are:
   - Shape: Both are spade shapes.
   - Color: Both are blue.
   - Size: One is large, and one is small.

   The relations over the features represented in Target Pair 1 are:
   - Shape: Same shape (spade).
   - Color: Same color (blue).
   - Size: Size difference (large and small).

   The features of the objects in Target Pair 2 are:
   - Shape: Both are square shapes.
   - Color: Both are black.
   - Size: One is large, and one is small.

   The relations over the features represented in Target Pair 2 are:
   - Shape: Same shape (square).
   - Color: Same color (black).
   - Size: Size difference (large and small).

4. Even though the color is different between the Source Pair and Target Pair 1, the relations over the shape and size are consistent. Both feature the same shape with a size difference between the objects. Target Pair 2 shares no shape similarity with the Source Pair, despite having the same color and size difference. Therefore, Target Pair 1 is the matching target pair as it shares the same relations (shape and size) with the Source Pair.",2

1. Identify the features:
- Source Pair: Both objects are spades. The left object is small and orange, while the right object is larger and yellow.
- Target Pair 1: Both objects are squares. The left object is small and black, while the right object is larger and black.
- Target Pair 2: Both objects are triangles. Both objects are pink and of the same size.

2. Identify the relations:
- The Source Pair relation is: same shape, different colors, different sizes.
- Target Pair 1 relation is: same shape, same color, different sizes.
- Target Pair 2 relation is: same shape, same color, same size.

3. Determine which target pair shares the same relations with the source pair:
- Target Pair 1 shares the same relationships as the Source Pair: the objects have the same shape (spades/squares), but differ in color and size.

4. Return the number of the matching target pair:
The matching target pair is Target Pair 1 because they both share the same relationship of objects having the same shape, but differing in color and size. Target Pair 2 does not share these relations as both objects are the same color and size.",1

The source pair features two black squares, one smaller than the other. The relation between the objects in the source pair can be identified as:
- Shape: identical (both are squares)
- Color: identical (both are black)
- Size: different (one is smaller than the other)

Now let's look at the target pairs:

Target Pair 1 features two green pentagons, one smaller than the other. The relations can be identified as:
- Shape: identical (both are pentagons)
- Color: identical (both are green)
- Size: different (one is smaller than the other)

Target Pair 2 features two black squares, one smaller than the other. The relations can be identified as:
- Shape: identical (both are squares)
- Color: identical (both are black)
- Size: different (one is smaller than the other)

Comparing the relations in the target pairs with those in the source pair, we can see that Target Pair 2 shares the same relations over all three features: shape, color, and size. Therefore, Target Pair 2 is the correct match to the source pair.",1

Therefore, Target Pair 1 is the correct match because it shares the same relations over all three features with the source pair.",1
