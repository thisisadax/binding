      source_object2: {shape: circle, color: purple}
    },
    target1: {
      target1_object1: {shape: triangle, color: brown},
      target1_object2: {shape: triangle, color: brown}
    },
    {
      target2_object1: {shape: square, color: green},
      target2_object2: {shape: square, color: black}
    }
