The following image depicts a trial of the relational match to sample task with three features: shape, color, and size. There are three pairs of objects relevant to your task: the source pair (the top pair of objects), target pair #2 (the pair of objects on bottom left), and target pair (the pair of objects on the bottom right). Your task is to identify which target pair shares the same abstract relations with the source pair. Only one target pair will share all the same relations with the source pair. Now, given the source pair and the two target pairs, identify the matching target pair. To accomplish this task, you can use the following steps:
Identify the features of the objects in each pair (i.e. shape, color, and size).
Identify the relations over the features represented in each pair.
Determine which target pair shares the same relations with the source pair.
Return the number of the target pair that matches the relations of the source pair and explain your reasoning.
