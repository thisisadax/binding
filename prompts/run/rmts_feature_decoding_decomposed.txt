What is the {feature} of the {object_loc} ({object_ind}) object in the given pair? Only provide the {feature}.
Your answer should be a single word describing the feature.
For instance, if I ask for color, you should return a color like "red", and if I ask for a shape, you should return a shape like "circle".
