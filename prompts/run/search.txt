You will be presented with an image that is part of a classic serial search task used in cognitive psychology studies. The image contains a set of letters, specifically the shapes 'L' and 'T'. These letters will appear in either red or green.

Your task is to identify whether the letter 'L' appears in the color red. Please follow the instructions below carefully:

1. Describe each letter in the image in detail, taking note of their colors.
2. Determine if either the 'L' appears in red.
3. Respond with "True" if 'L' appears in red. Respond with "False" if there is no red 'L'. 

Make sure to check each letter before making your determination.
