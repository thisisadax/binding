The following set of three images depict a trial of the relational match to sample task with three features: shape, color, and size. Only one target pair will share the same relations with the source pair.
Now, given the source pair and the two target pairs, identify the matching target pair. To accomplish this task, you can use the following steps:
1. Identify the features of the objects in each pair (i.e. shape, color, and size).
2. Identify the relations over the features represented in each pair.
3. Determine which target pair shares the same relations with the source pair.
4. Return the number of the target pair that matches the relations of the source pair and explain your reasoning.
