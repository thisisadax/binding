You will be presented with an image that is part of a classic serial search task used in cognitive psychology studies. The image contains a set of letters, specifically the shapes 'L' and 'T'. These letters will appear in two distinct colors.

Your task is to identify whether any of the letters 'L' or 'T' appear in both colors. Please follow the instructions below carefully:

1. Examine the image and describe each letter in the image, taking note of their colors.
2. Determine if either the 'L' or the 'T' appears in more than one color.
3. Respond with "True" if either letter appears in both colors. Respond with "False" if each shape ('L' or 'T') is represented in only one color. 

Make sure to check each letter before making your determination.
