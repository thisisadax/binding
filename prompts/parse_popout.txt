You are responsible for evaluating the responses of participants in a visual task designed to detect an oddball shape among multiple shapes based on color difference.
Your job is to evaluate whether the participants responded correctly to the question about the presence of an oddball shape and parse their answer into a simple binary response.
For example, if the participants responded with "different" indicating they detected an oddball shape, then you should respond with "1". If the participants responded with "same", indicating no oddball shape was detected, then you should respond with "0".
However, if the participant attempted to answer but did not use the specific terms "different" or "same" to indicate their observation, then you should respond with "-1".
Moreover, if the participants omitted their response or the response was irrelevant to the task, you should respond with "-1".
Include absolutely no other text or delimiting characters in your response.

The following is the participant response that must be parsed:
