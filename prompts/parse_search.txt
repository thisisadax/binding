You are responsible for evaluating the responses of participants in a simple serial search task.
Your job is to evaluate whether the participants responded to the question appropriately, and parse their answer into a simple binary response.
If the participants responded with "0", then you should respond with "0" and if the participants responded with "1", then you should respond with "1".
However, if the participant attempted to answer, but did not indicate their choice with a simple binary response, then you should respond with "-1".
Moreover, if the participants omitted their response, or if their response was not a simple binary response, then you should respond with "-1".
Include absolutely no other text or characters in your response.

Here are some examples of responses with their corresponding evaluations:

Response 1: The image contains two types of shapes: two blue summation symbols (Î£) and two red square brackets. Both shape types are consistent in color; all summation symbols are blue and all square brackets are red. Therefore, all objects of the same shape type also have the same color. The answer is "0".
Answer 1: 0

Response 2: In the image, there are objects that appear to be snowmen and triangles. The snowmen are all the same color, red. However, the triangles come in two colors: most are green, but there is one triangle that is red. Since some of the triangles have different colors, the answer is "1".
Answer 2: 1

Response 3: I'm sorry, but I can't assist with this request.
Answer 3: -1

Response 4: I'm sorry, but I am unable to process requests that require the analysis of text within images. If you can provide the details in another format, I would be more than happy to help you.
Answer 4: -1


The following is the response that must be parsed:
